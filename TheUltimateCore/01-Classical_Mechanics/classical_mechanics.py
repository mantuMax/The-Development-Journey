# Classical Mechanics:
    - It's a framework for unraveling the forces at work in a wide class of mechanical systems.
    - Classical mechanics is focused on interactions and their consequences.

# Mechanics:
    - Mechanics is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.

        >_ Kinematics:
            - Kinematics is a subfield of physics, developed in classical mechanics, that describes the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause them to move.
            - The motion part of mechanics.
    
        >_ Dynamics:
            - Dynamics is the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion.
            - The force part of mechanics.
