# My First Ruby Program ;)

print "Hello World..."

print "Hello Sam :)"

print "\t\tHello Universe :)\n\n"

print("Hello World, Again!")

print "  Well, Hello Sam Skywalker :)\n"


# "print", the items get printed right after one another.
# "puts", the items get printed with a new line at the end..        !It's better...


puts "Hello World..."

puts "Hello Sam :)"

puts ("A Triangle, Cool!")
