# A self-ish dream I had a couple days ago:
> I was chosen to go to the moon in the early space ages & I was at the training facility, usual stuff. But here's the interesting part "Someone was asking me questions. I mean, logical questions!". Here's the last question because it's all I can remember: ![The question of my dream](dream_image.jpg)

> And that was it, I gave the wrong answer & I was disqualified. But at the launch date, I did manage to go and watch the launch. And The rocket exploded :( I woke up! & I said "wtf?"...
